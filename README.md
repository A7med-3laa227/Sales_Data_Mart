ðŸ“ˆ Sales Data Mart Design Using AdventureWorks Database

This GitHub repository contains comprehensive documentation for a Sales Data Mart project. The objective of this project is to develop a robust data mart from the AdventureWorks database, encompassing fact tables for sales data and dimension tables for products, customers, time, and territories. Adopting a dimensional modeling approach, the project includes detailed processes for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

Data Model:
The data mart is structured with the following dimensional model:

Fact Sales: Contains sales-related measures and foreign keys linking to dimensions.

Dim Product: Stores detailed product information, including attributes such as product name, category, and subcategory.

Dim Customer: Includes comprehensive customer details and supports Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) processing to manage customer changes.

Dim Time: Represents various time-related information, including date, month, quarter, and year.

Dim Territory: Contains territory information with attributes such as region, country, and state.

This project ensures an accurate and reliable data mart, facilitating advanced analytics and informed decision-making.
